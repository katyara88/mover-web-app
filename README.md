* **Governance.**

* **Nibble Shop.**
A place where Mover official merchandise lives. All items here are tokenized, meaning that you can buy a token that gives you the right to claim an item. Since all items are tokenized, they are limited and require on-chain transactions. You can buy, sell or redeem cool merch here.

* **NFT Drops.**
Every once in a while, there is either a promo, or a surprise NFT drop. All our NFTs have superpowers (some features that make the Mover service better). This section allows you to check the eligibility for a specific NFT, claim the NFT, or use it (depends on the NFT superpower).
